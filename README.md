I understand including executable code directly in a readme file can bloat the repository and make it harder to manage. It's better practice to reference the location of the code within the project. Here's an updated readme.md that reflects this:

## Java Movie Ticket Reservation System (Summer Vacation Project)

**By Abhinav Gupta, Class 11**

This repository contains a Java program for a movie ticket reservation system, submitted as a summer vacation project to Mr. Raghav Singh Yadav. 

**Features:**

* **Explore Movies:** Browse currently playing movies with titles and descriptions.
* **Showtime Selection:** Choose a movie to see available showtimes and timings.
* **Seat Reservation:** Select seats for a specific showtime and reserve them (**Note:** Reservations are temporary). 
* **In-Memory Tracking:** Track seat availability in real-time (data is not saved after program termination).

**Who is this for?**

* Beginner Java programmers seeking a project to practice core concepts (classes, objects, data structures).
* Anyone interested in building a basic movie ticket reservation system for learning purposes.

**Limitations:**

* **Temporary Reservations:**  Reservations are not stored permanently and are lost when the program closes.
* **Basic Functionality:**  Lacks user accounts, payment processing, and advanced seat selection features.

**Getting Started (For Mr. Raghav Singh Yadav):**

1. Clone this repository using Git ([https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)).
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. The source code for the program can be found in the `src/main/java` directory. The main class to start the program is typically named `MovieTicketReservationSystem.java` (or similar).

**Further Development:**

This program lays the groundwork for a more robust movie ticket reservation system. You can explore advancements by:

* Implementing a database (e.g., MySQL) for persistent storage of movies, showtimes, and reservations.
* Adding user accounts and authentication for secure access.
* Integrating a payment gateway to simulate online transactions.
* Creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a user-friendly experience.

**Disclaimer:**

This program is a basic learning exercise and not intended for production use. It requires additional features like error handling, security measures, and scalability for real-world application.

**Deadline:**

Please note that all submissions for this project are due by **July 15th, 2024**. Submissions received after this date will not be considered.

I hope this project demonstrates my understanding of Java programming concepts. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require further explanation.

**Best Regards,**

Abhinav Gupta
